- Always put JS link at bottom of file so that HTML and CSS loads first before JS could start.

- `var` have global scope thus are not used any more and good practice is to use `let` and `const` which have block level scope.

- `const` can't be reassigned while `let` can. Also `const` is initialized only as the time of declaring the variable.

- JS is not a strictly typed language (no need to define variable type) while typescript which is a super set of JS have this feature.
